The workflow integrates multistep single-cell, 1D and 2D model simulations in a single automated process. The model formulation for ventricular cells from humans (Grandi-Bers*) are implemented in the workflow. The model contains beta-adrenergic signaling pathways, and the firing rate model (unpublished Lewis model).
