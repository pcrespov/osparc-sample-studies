## Model of autonomic control of cardiac function

The workflow contains a model of autonomic nervous activity and heart rate. Additionally, a pre-instantiated jupyter notebook is connected that plots the results of simulation. The model here is described in a publication: Recurrent myocardial infarction: Mechanisms of free-floating adaptation and autonomic derangement in networked cardiac neural control.
